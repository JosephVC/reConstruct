Questions concerning mysite.urls.py
================================================================
Are the wasteprocessor url's only supposed to be included
when the begining of the url contains "material-search"
# url(r'^material-search/', include('wasteprocessors.urls')),
url(r'^', include('wasteprocessors.urls')),
What is this used for, example?

in wasteprocessors urls.py "project/P<project_slug>-a" does not
appear to match url(r'^project/(?P<project_slug>[-\w]+)/$'
What are these used for, example?

in wasteprocessors urls.py "results/P<waste_id>2" does not
appear to match url(r'^results/(?P<waste_id>\d+)/$'
What is this used for, example?

Are there any admin.site urls, or is this just a placeholder?
url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls)

Are there any registration urls, or is this just a placeholder?
url(r'^accounts/', include('registration.backends.simple.urls'))

Does the myblog app do anything for us or is it just residual
and can be deleted?
