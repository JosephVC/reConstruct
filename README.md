reConstruct is a Django app allowing homeowners and contractors to readily 
contact various waste processors (recycling, salvage, etc.).  New users 
create a profile, select the sort of project they are working on, select the 
sort of material they will be generating from the project, and then see what
sort of companies deal with that sort of material.
