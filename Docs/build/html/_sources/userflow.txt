**Adding a Project**

The following is an example of a user adding a new project.

When a new project is added, the user specifies what sort of material they
are getting rid of.

When the above information is submitted, the user should see what local 
businesses take the given salvage material.  Options on the left side
of the screen allow the user to filter their search results.  If no results
match the filter creiteria, the user can uncheck the boxes or resubmit
the salvage materials that will come from their project.
