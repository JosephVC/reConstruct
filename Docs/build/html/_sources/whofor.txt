Who reConstruct Is For
======================

**For the Homeowner**

Individual homeowners can use reConstruct to better communicate with the 
various recyclers and waste processors in their area.  Rather than let
materials sit on a curb for days, people can quickly and efficiently 
look up which business are near then that deal with their respective 
construction waste material.  

**For the Contractor**

Contractors see the same benefit that homeowners do.  reConstruct 
can be even more useful for contractors, as the latter often deal
with far larger projects than the individual homeowner.
